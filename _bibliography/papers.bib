The framework covers multiple scenarios including noisy labeled AUC optimization, positive-unlabeled AUC optimization, multi-instance AUC optimization, and semi-supervised AUC optimization with or without noise. The framework achieves robust AUC optimization through a novel variety of AUC, i.e., rpAUC. Theorical and empirical results validate the effectiveness of the framework.},

  abstract    = {Weakly supervised learning aims to empower machine learning when the perfect supervision is unavailable, which has drawn great attention from researchers. Among various types of weak supervision, one of the most challenging cases is to learn from multiple unlabeled (U) datasets with only a little knowledge of the class priors, or U^m learning for short. In this paper, we study the problem of building an AUC (area under ROC curve) optimization model from multiple unlabeled datasets, which maximizes the pairwise ranking ability of the classifier. We propose U^m-AUC, an AUC optimization approach that converts the U^m data into a multi-label AUC optimization problem, and can be trained efficiently. We show that the proposed U^m-AUC is effective theoretically and empirically.},

  abstract    = {Program translation aims to convert the input programs from one programming language to another. Automatic program translation is a prized target of software engineering research, which leverages the reusability of projects and improves the efficiency of development. Recently, thanks to the rapid development of deep learning model architectures and the availability of large-scale parallel corpus of programs, the performance of program translation has been greatly improved. However, the existing program translation models are still far from satisfactory, in terms of the quality of translated programs. In this paper, we argue that a major limitation of the current approaches is lack of consideration of semantic consistency. Beyond lexical consistency, semantic consistency is also critical for the task. To make the program translation model more semantically aware, we propose a general framework named Preserving Semantic Consistency for Program Translation (PSCPT), which considers semantic consistency with regularization in the training objective of program translation and can be easily applied to all encoder-decoder methods with various neural networks~(e.g., LSTM, Transformer) as the backbone. We conduct extensive experiments in 7 general programming languages. Experimental results show that with CodeBERT as the backbone, our approach outperforms not only the state-of-the-art open-source models but also the commercial closed large language models~(e.g., text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003) on the program translation task. Our replication package~(including code, data, etc.) is publicly available at https://github.com/duyali2000/PSCPT .},

To achieve this, CALE swaps the cooperative examples of the two objectives, enabling the learning of discriminability and transferability to mutually benefit each other. Additionally, adversarial examples are utilized to enhance the robustness of the two objectives themselves. The framework can be applied to improve current domain adaptation approaches and has been shown to outperform existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract    = {In this paper, we address a special scenario of semi-supervised learning, where the label missing is caused by a preceding ﬁltering mechanism, i.e., an instance can enter a subsequent process in which its label is revealed if and only if it passes the ﬁltering mechanism. The rejected instances are prohibited to enter the subsequent labeling process due to economical or ethical reasons, making the support of the labeled and unlabeled distributions isolated from each other. In this case, classical semi-supervised learning approaches are prone to fail. We propose a SmallPaced Self-Training framework, which iteratively discovers labeled and unlabeled instance subspaces with bounded Wasserstein distance. We theoretically prove that such a framework may achieve provably low error on the pseudo labels during learning, and validate the approach through experiments.},
