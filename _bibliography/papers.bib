  abstract    = {Estimating the post-click conversion rate (CVR) accurately in ranking systems is crucial for industrial applications. However, this task faces challenges of data sparsity and selection bias, which hinder accurate ranking. Previous approaches attempting to address these challenges often involve a trade-off: either training models on the entire exposure space without unbiased CVR estimation, or providing unbiased CVR estimation without modeling CVR across the entire exposure space. To overcome this trade-off, we propose the Entire-space Weighted Area Under the Curve (EWAUC) framework, which formulates the CVR estimation task as an AUC optimization problem. EWAUC leverages sample reweighting techniques to handle selection bias, and employs pairwise AUC risk to incorporate more information from limited clicked data than cross-entropy and handle data sparsity. In order to model CVR across the entire exposure space in an unbiased manner, EWAUC treats the exposure data as both conversion data and non-conversion data. The properties of AUC risk guarantee the unbiased nature of the entire-space modeling. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis to validate the unbiased nature of our approach. Additionally, extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of ranking performance for the CVR estimation task.},

  abstract    = {Abductive Learning (ABL) is a promising framework for integrating sub-symbolic perception and logical reasoning through abduction. In this case, the abduction process provides supervision for the perception model from the background knowledge. Nevertheless, this process naturally contains uncertainty, since the knowledge base may be satisfied by numerous potential candidates. This implies that the result of the abduction process, i.e., a set of candidates, is ambiguous; both correct and incorrect candidates are mixed in this set. The prior art of abductive learning selects the candidate that has the minimal inconsistency of the knowledge base. However, this method overlooks the ambiguity in the abduction process and is prone to error when it fails to identify the correct candidates. To address this, we propose Ambiguity-Aware Abductive Learning (A3BL), which evaluates all potential candidates and their probabilities, thus preventing the model from falling into sub-optimal solutions. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses prove that A3BL markedly enhances ABL by efficiently exploiting the ambiguous abduced supervision.},

Among various types of weak supervision, one of the most challenging cases is to learn from multiple unlabeled (U) datasets with only a little knowledge of the class priors, or U^m learning for short. In this paper, we study the problem of building an AUC (area under ROC curve) optimization model from multiple unlabeled datasets, which maximizes the pairwise ranking ability of the classifier. We propose U^m-AUC, an AUC optimization approach that converts the U^m data into a multi-label AUC optimization problem, and can be trained efficiently. We show that the proposed U^m-AUC is effective theoretically and empirically.},

Recently, approaches based on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable code generation abilities on simple tasks. However, generate code for more complex tasks, such as competition-level problems, remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Brainstorm framework for code generation. It leverages a brainstorming step that generates and selects diverse thoughts on the problem to facilitate algorithmic reasoning, where the thoughts are possible blueprint of solving the problem. We demonstrate that Brainstorm significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to solve competition-level programming problems, resulting in a more than 50% increase in the pass@k metrics for ChatGPT on the CodeContests benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our experiments conducted on LeetCode contests show that our framework boosts the ability of ChatGPT to a level comparable to that of human programmers.},

  abstract    = {Program translation aims to convert the input programs from one programming language to another. Automatic program translation is a prized target of software engineering research, which leverages the reusability of projects and improves the efficiency of development. Recently, thanks to the rapid development of deep learning model architectures and the availability of large-scale parallel corpus of programs, the performance of program translation has been greatly improved. However, the existing program translation models are still far from satisfactory, in terms of the quality of translated programs. In this paper, we argue that a major limitation of the current approaches is lack of consideration of semantic consistency. Beyond lexical consistency, semantic consistency is also critical for the task. To make the program translation model more semantically aware, we propose a general framework named Preserving Semantic Consistency for Program Translation (PSCPT), which considers semantic consistency with regularization in the training objective of program translation and can be easily applied to all encoder-decoder methods with various neural networks~(e.g., LSTM, Transformer) as the backbone. We conduct extensive experiments in 7 general programming languages. Experimental results show that with CodeBERT as the backbone, our approach outperforms not only the state-of-the-art open-source models but also the commercial closed large language models~(e.g., text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003) on the program translation task. Our replication package~(including code, data, etc.) is publicly available at https://github.com/duyali2000/PSCPT .},

  abstract    = {In this paper, we address a special scenario of semi-supervised learning, where the label missing is caused by a preceding ﬁltering mechanism, i.e., an instance can enter a subsequent process in which its label is revealed if and only if it passes the ﬁltering mechanism. The rejected instances are prohibited to enter the subsequent labeling process due to economical or ethical reasons, making the support of the labeled and unlabeled distributions isolated from each other. In this case, classical semi-supervised learning approaches are prone to fail. We propose a SmallPaced Self-Training framework, which iteratively discovers labeled and unlabeled instance subspaces with bounded Wasserstein distance. We theoretically prove that such a framework may achieve provably low error on the pseudo labels during learning, and validate the approach through experiments.},
